This is a deep learning project to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP). The dataset contains 9568 data points collected over six years (2006-2011) when the power plant was operating at full load. Features include hourly average ambient variables: Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), and Exhaust Vacuum (V). In this project, we used an artificial neural network for regression
